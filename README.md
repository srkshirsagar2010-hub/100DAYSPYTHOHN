# 🎵 Day 1 – Band Name Generator  
This is my **Day 1 project** from the *100 Days of Python* challenge.  
The goal of this project is to understand basic Python concepts such as:

- Printing text  
- Taking user input  
- String concatenation  
- Creating simple interactive programs  

---

## 🚀 **Project Description**
This project asks the user two questions:

1. **Which city they grew up in**
2. **What is their pet's name**

Using this information, the program generates a fun and personalized **Band Name**.

---

## 🧠 **Concepts Used**
- `print()`  
- `input()`  
- Variables  
- String formatting  
- Simple user interaction  

---

## 💻 **Code**
```python
print("WELCOME TO BAND NAME GENERATOR")
name = input("Which city did you grew up in?\n")

username = input("What is your pet name?\n")

print("The name of your Band is " + name + " " + username)
