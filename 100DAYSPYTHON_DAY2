💰 Day 2 – Tip Calculator (Python)

This is my Day 2 project from the 100 Days of Python Bootcamp.
The goal of this project is to practice:

Taking user input

Converting data types

Performing arithmetic operations

Basic logic

Simple real-life Python applications

🚀 Project Description

This Python program works as a Tip Calculator.
It asks the user:

Total bill amount

Tip percentage (10, 20, or 30)

Number of people sharing the bill

Then it calculates how much each person should pay.

🧠 Concepts Used

input()

float() and int()

Arithmetic operations

Variables

Basic user interaction

💻 Code
print("WELCOME TO THE TIP CALCULATOR!")
bill = float(input("What was the total bill?"))
tip = int(input("How much tip would u like to give? 10 20 or 30"))
split = int(input("How many people to split the bill between?"))
bill_to_pay = (bill + tip) / split
print("Each person should pay:")
print(bill_to_pay)
